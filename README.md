# COMP1350: Introduction to Database Design and Management

**Overview**

In this unit, I was introduced to the principles and concepts of data storage, modelling, and management, emphasising the role of data and information in organisations. I covered conceptual modelling techniques, converted conceptual data models into relational data models, and verified their structural characteristics with normalisation techniques. I also implemented and utilised a relational database using a database-management system.

I used fundamental data modelling techniques such as ER Modelling and query languages like Structured Query Language (SQL). I delved into concepts relating to data warehousing, governance, administration, security and privacy, ethical and green approaches to the collection, backup, use, and storage of data, and the construction of systems.

Overall, I focused on building a firm foundation in information representation, organisation, and storage, with a particular emphasis on the application of database systems. This unit was designed to equip me with a comprehensive understanding of how data is structured and managed in an organisational context.

**Assignment 1: Design Task**

In Assignment 1: Design Task, I used both a top-down and a bottom-up approach in database modelling. My assessment was based on the development of an EER diagram, logical transformation, and normalisation of tables for a given problem description.

**Assignment 2: Programming Task**

In Assignment 2: Programming Task, I designed and executed database queries to demonstrate my knowledge of SQL. My assessment was based on the successful execution of SQL queries for a given problem description.
